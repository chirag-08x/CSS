/* When we set position : relative for an element, we can use top, bottom, left, right property on that element. While using these properties the element moves relaitve to the position where it was placed intially. The top, bottom, left, right property can also overflows the div in which they are contianed and can also overlap with other elements. The problem with position relative is thay when it moves the element to top, left, bottom, right the space reserved for that element does not gets filled up by the next element */
